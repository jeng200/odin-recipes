This is my Recipes project from The Odin Project. I am currently learning HTML.

Skills that I have demonstrated in this project are:
    *HTML and file structure
    *Ordered and unordered lists
    *Adding links and images
    *Linking additional HTML pages to main page
    *Headings and paragraphs
    *Git and Github workflows
